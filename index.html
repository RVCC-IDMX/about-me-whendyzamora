        <h2 style="font-size:3vw;">Biography</h2>
   
        <div>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">As the first generation child of two Afro-Colombians, I was born and raised in Plainfield, NJ. I accompanied my mother as she cleaned houses for middle-class to upper-class families at a young age. While surrounded by those beautifully arranged homes, that is where my love for decorating began.
   
        Even though deep down, I knew decorating was my passion, this did not stop me from questioning my niche and what made me feel fulfilled. When finally, at the age of 27, I realized what I should have known all along- it was Interior Design, duh! I quickly changed my major, excelled in my studies by achieving the Dean’s List, and I became a student member of the American Society for Interior Designers.
   
        Although it has been a long voyage for me, I would not trade my creative journey for anything else in this world. There is so much beauty in the foundation of our life journey, and this is only the beginning!</p>
   
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">I want to be...</p>
   
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">Happy as a Web Developer! In reality, anything that allows me to express my creativity in a way that I see fit—be it Interior Design, painting, and (now) Web Development:)</p>
   
        </div>
   
        <div>
   
        <p style="font-size:2vw;"> My passions are... </p>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">Many, many things being a multi-hyphenate. Yet, at the age of 31, I seem to have narrowed them down to help me become the powerhouse I know I am meant to be. I plan on becoming an Interior Decorator/Web Developer/Marketer in the hopes of opening a brick and mortar with my partner. I believe having those skills will help attain our goals!</p>

    <h2 style="font-size:3vw;">Variable Fonts</h2>

    <div>
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">When the first thought of variable fonts arises, in all likelihood, the first thought should be on the right path. The definition is practically in the name. However, let us look at a formal definition. At developer.mozilla “variable fonts are an evolution of the OpenType font specification that enables many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file, rather than having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style.” To put it into layman’s terms, what did they mean in reality? It simply means they are fonts that can be adjusted—sounds excellent. Nevertheless, like with everything in life, one must take the good with the bad, meaning that variable fonts have cons. Even so, being able to modify fonts is functional, yet they are an underrated tool. Now, why is that? Variable fonts have been around for many years and have come a long way. However, while the technology has advanced, it does not mean that variable fonts are popular or even widely used. Variable fonts do not have market demand, or there are not many instruments that utilize them. Not to mention, not all browsers support design apps, according to typetype.org. </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/variable-n.gif" id="image4" alt="a variable font n" width="400" height="200">
        </figure>
        <figcaption style="font-size:2vw;">(courtesy of TT Norms Pro Variable)</figcaption>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="img/Browser Variable.png" id="image5" alt="a chart of browsers that support design apps" width="400" height="200">
            <figcaption style="font-size:2vw;">(courtesy of v-fonts.com)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p style="font-size:2vw;">To be clear, variable fonts do not have filters or effects that can be added on top of the font. So no, they are already directly built into the font. This means the span and possibilities of the font design have already been created and considered by the font designer. Therefore, proceed with caution. One must also keep in mind that not all fonts are variable fonts. Nonetheless, they can be found at sites like Adobe Fonts, which have a few in their font library, and Google Fonts also have them. So despite those top-dog companies, one may want to support smaller businesses. No worries, that is why I am here—Check out all the fun places where variable fonts can be found too:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href=https://www.futurefonts.xyz>Futurefonts.xyz</a></li>
                <li><a href=https://djr.com>Djr.com</a></li>
                <li><a href=https://www.briefcasetype.com>Briefcasetype.com</a></li>
                <li><a href=http://gt-alpina.com>Gt-alpina.com</a></li>
            </ul>
        
       <p style="font-size:2vw;">First, design software that supports these types of fonts is needed. However, the technologies are in the early days for this upcoming software, Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign work! Unfortunately, according to future fonts.xyz, the interface to control variable fonts is a tad bit hidden, but luckily they have got that covered:</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p style="font-size:2vw;">What a great tool to help create some CSS animation! Unfortunately, it can be tricky to produce animation unless you are not afraid to play around with some coding. Animation, one of the building blocks of multimedia, is essential if you want to draw attention to a website. Maybe you are just starting, and a bit overwhelmed—Hakuna Matata (Swahili for “no worries” and the catchphrase of the iconic film The Lion King lol), just like everything else on the internet… there are resources like— <a href="https://github.com/futurefonts/type-animations.">Github.com</a></p>
